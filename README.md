# DEFCON

This is a program I wrote for the Raspberry Pi SBC. It turns on some LEDS.

## Requirements
  - A Raspberry Pi 
  - Python2.7 or higher
  - smtplib, random and RPi.GPIO python libraries.
  - LEDs and Breadboards, approx. 15 LEDs.
  - A GMail address
  - Time to understand my uncommented code (Comments take effort, and screw effort)

## Side Notes
This is still kind of a work in progress, don't judge too harshly

## Licence
I'm using a Creative Commons licence as some jerk kept stealing my programs and passing them off as his own. I'm sorry if this annoys anyone.
